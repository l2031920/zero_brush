Ludivic told me that his repository was taken down but that he moved on. I still think that the GPLv2 and the FAQ on blender's
homepage is clear enough:

What about Add-ons or my Python scripts?
If you share or publish Python scripts – if they use the Blender API calls – have to be made
available compliant to the GNU GPL as well.

It was published, it uses Blender's API, so it the GPL applys.
